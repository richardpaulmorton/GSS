I want to do a personal coding project. It will be a generational spaceship simulator. I want to code it with 10 different languages. The database it uses will be MS SQL. I want the project to have api's. I want it to have a web front end. Give me a list of ideas for how to implement different languages for each part.
The generational ship will be a self-learning AI focused on sustaining a population for 1000 years to it's destination. When the population decreases then the system should make adjustments for why it's decreasing. 
Each person on the generational spaceship will have attributes such as thirst, hunger, CO2 levels based on how much oxygen the ship's flora is producing.
There should be edible plants and animals, also non-edible plants and animals that won't be eaten for other uses.
Give me a list of the programs and systems needed for this project and I will ask for more details.

To implement this generational spaceship simulator with 10 different programming languages, you could use a microservices architecture. Each microservice would be responsible for a specific functionality, and you can code each one in a different language. Here's a list of ideas for dividing the project into microservices and the languages you can use for each:

Simulation Engine (C++): This service will handle the core simulation logic, including the AI, physics, and the life-sustaining systems of the spaceship.

Population Management (Java): This service will manage the population, their attributes, and their needs. It will also interact with the Simulation Engine to make adjustments based on the current population.

Flora and Fauna Management (Python): This service will manage the plants and animals, both edible and non-edible, and their interactions with the population and the environment.

Resource Management (Go): This service will handle the resources on the ship, such as water, air, and energy, and their distribution among the population, flora, and fauna.

Event Management (Rust): This service will manage random events and disasters, as well as their effects on the population, flora, fauna, and resources.

Web API (Node.js/JavaScript): This service will expose the functionalities of the other microservices through a RESTful API, allowing the web frontend and other external applications to interact with the simulation.

Web Frontend (React or Angular/TypeScript): This will be the web application that users can access to interact with the simulation, visualize the spaceship, and monitor the status of the population, flora, fauna, and resources.

Authentication and Authorization (Ruby): This service will manage user accounts, access control, and secure communication between the frontend and the API.

Analytics and Reporting (Scala): This service will process and analyze the data generated by the simulation to provide insights, trends, and recommendations.

Database Access Layer (C#): This service will handle all communication with the MS SQL database, providing a consistent interface for the other microservices to interact with the data.

You will also need the following tools and systems for this project:

MS SQL Server: The database that will store all the data for your simulation.
Git: A version control system for tracking changes in your code.
Docker: A containerization platform to package your microservices and manage their deployment.
Kubernetes or Docker Swarm: An orchestration platform to manage and scale your microservices.
CI/CD pipeline tools: Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
Monitoring and Logging: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to monitor your microservices and analyze logs.
Once you have a clear understanding of each component's role, you can start working on each microservice individually, leveraging the strengths of the selected programming languages for each task.
